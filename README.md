# Ultimate C++ Course - 2 - Intermediate



## Contents

There are 5 Units in this intermediate level C++ course:

- Unit 1 - Arrays
- Unit 2 - Pointers
- Unit 3 - Strings
- Unit 4 - Structures
- Unit 5 - Streams



## Codebase

I have typed in all of the codes as per the videos.

Due to the "int main()" function can only occur once in the project, I have structured the codes for every units:

1. the `main.cpp` is the app you can run, the rest `main#-title-blah-blah.cpp` are for backup, 

2. you can copy the `main#-title-blah-blah.cpp` to `main.cpp`, then run the commands below in the `unit#` folder:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ./main
   ```
